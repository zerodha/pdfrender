PDF text overlay API built on frappe based on https://github.com/shridarpatil/pdf_text_overlay. This App maintains a repository of PDF files which serve as templates and configuration of variable names and positions to be rendered on the pdf file.

An web API is exposed which accepts data and template ID and returns a PDF filled with data (text) overlaid on configured positions.
